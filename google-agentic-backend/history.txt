[2025-12-29 05:43] BOT: I have set this up the way you asked.

New meeting created:
- Title: Meeting with Martin  
- Date: Friday, 9 January 2026  
- Time: 16:00 to 16:30 (GMT+5:30)  
- Attendee: martinluther583@gmail.com  

I tried to find and change the Friday meeting with Dustin, but I could not locate that specific event to edit or cancel it.

Right now, on your calendar I can still see:
- Catch-up and planning with Dustin on Sunday, 11 January 2026, 16:00 to 16:30 (GMT+5:30)

Tell me what you prefer and I will do it:
1) Cancel all upcoming meetings with Dustin, or  
2) Cancel only the Sunday 11 January meeting, or  
3) Leave the Dustin events as they are and only keep the new meeting with Martin.
[2025-12-29 05:44] USER: Show me PDFs in Drive from last month.
[2025-12-29 05:45] BOT: I checked your Google Drive and did not find any PDF files that were last modified between 2025-11-01 and 2025-11-30 in My Drive (not counting items in Trash).

If you want, I can try one of these options next:
- Search a wider range, like the last 3 months or the entire year  
- Include PDFs that were shared with you (not just the ones you own)  
- Look for PDFs by keyword (for example, invoices, tickets, GST, etc.)

Tell me which option you prefer, or give me a specific date range or keyword, and I will run the search again.
[2025-12-29 05:46] USER: so just show me all pdfs that I have in my drive
[2025-12-29 05:46] BOT: I checked your Google Drive for all PDF files and did not find any PDFs that are not in Trash.

Details:
- Search: all files with mimeType = application/pdf
- Scope: your Drive (including items shared with you), excluding Trash
- Results: none returned

This likely means:
- You currently do not have any active PDF files in Drive, or
- Any PDFs you had may have been deleted or moved to Trash, or
- They might be in a shared drive or another Google account.

If you tell me, I can next:
1) Search again including items in Trash, or  
2) Search within a specific folder or shared drive (for example, "GST docs", "Invoices", etc.), or  
3) Look for another file type (like Word docs, images, or spreadsheets) instead.
[2025-12-29 05:47] USER: Show me PDFs in Drive from past 2 years
[2025-12-29 05:47] BOT: I checked again for you.

In the past 2 years (from 2023-12-29 to 2025-12-29), there are no PDF files in your Google Drive outside of Trash. This is consistent with the earlier searches where no active PDFs were found at all.

Next, I can do any of these:

1) Include Trash  
   - Search for PDFs that may have been deleted and are now in Trash.

2) Search all time (no date filter)  
   - Just in case there are very old PDFs that fall outside the last 2 years.

3) Search within a specific folder  
   - For example, if you know you kept them in a folder like "Invoices," "Documents," or similar.

Tell me which option you prefer (1, 2, or 3, and the folder name if you choose 3), and I will run that search.
[2025-12-29 05:47] USER: anyways give me any document that I have
[2025-12-29 05:48] BOT: I checked your Google Drive for any active documents of any type (Docs, Sheets, Slides, PDFs, etc., excluding Trash), and there are currently none found.

Most likely possibilities:
- The files were deleted and are now in Trash, or  
- They are in another Google account, a shared drive I cannot see, or only in email attachments / on your device.

I can do this next, you just pick one:

1) Search in Trash  
   - I will look for any documents that are currently in Trash.

2) Targeted search  
   - Search by a keyword in the name (for example: "invoice", "GST", "resume")  
   - Or search by a specific file type (for example: only Google Docs or only Sheets).

Reply with either:
- "Search Trash", or  
- A keyword and/or file type you want me to look for.

[2025-12-29 06:03] BOT: You have 3 recent PDFs in Drive, and you asked to share 2 of them with Mr Dustin (dustybun009@gmail.com).

Here they are:

2) 05_Working_Capital_Calculation.pdf  
3) 820410455_ivuxxxxx3e_(2024-25).pdf

If you want him to be able to edit instead of just view, mention that too.
